# Real Disaster Tweet Classification using Machine Learning

- Participated in a competition focused on developing a machine learning model to predict whether tweets are about real disasters.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset consisting of 10,000 tweets using various techniques:
    - Checked for null values and identified ***2533 null values** in the `location` column* and ***61 null values** in the `keyword` column*.
    - Conducted text preprocessing, including removal of links, extraction of hashtags, removal of mentions, removal of stopwords, and lemmatization.
    - Extracted locations from the clean text to treat null values in the `location` column.
    - Used extracted hashtags to treat null values in the `keyword` column.
    - Replaced remaining null values with "NA".
    - Added additional columns: `text_length` (length of the text) and `word_count` (number of words in the cleaned text).
    - Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
    - Utilized Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer for text vectorization, with Count Vectorizer yielding better accuracy.
- After vectorization, the *dataset had **5 rows and 14996 columns***.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Implemented the following *algorithms* for modeling:
    - Gaussian Naive Bayes
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - Logistic Regression
    - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Achieved the highest *accuracy score of **0.8025*** on the testing dataset using the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model.
